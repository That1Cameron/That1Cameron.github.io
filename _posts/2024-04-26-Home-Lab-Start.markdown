Recently I came into possetion of an old Linksys WAG160N router and handful of switches. These long with my various Raspberry Pis and old laptops should provide a suffitient start. I want this to be a lab that I can do anything on including attempting to gain access too through unintended methods. My home service provider allows my household 1 externally held DMZ, so that is where I am going to host my lab. In total currently the devices I have set aside for this job indlude:

    - Router
    - 2 x Pi3
    - pi4
    - Thinkpad workstation
    - Various Switches

The overall goal is to experiemnt with network managemnt, different services, and cyber security principals. I plan on putting OpenWRT on the router so that I can use a more custom firewall and routing software such as possibly PFsense. I also plan on putting Security Onion on one of the Pi3s so that I have some centrilized logging software setup. I may set up an SQL server on the other Pi3 but I have yet to decide.

I probably wont make a lot of progress on this project until the current semester is over but I am looking forward to getting all of this working and have the ability to experiment with it.
